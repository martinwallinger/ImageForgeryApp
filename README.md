# ImageForgeryApp

to start the webserver type "node staticExpress.js" in the terminal

[Steps for preparing this in an EC2 Instance]
1. Make sure the EC2 instance is able to take inbound connections to port 3000. (Security Group)
2. Download and install all the python libraries in the requirements text file in the python folder (through python3)
3. Make sure to install git in order to clone this repository
4. Install node.js as well to run the website server

if the output text for the prediction is weird, try changing the element number in the results to either 1 or 2 [staticExpress.js]. The output slightly changes depending on what machine you use it on
